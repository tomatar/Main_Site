      I also am a prominent member of our school's quizzing club - Enigma. I frequently go for interschool competitions and conduct quizzes
      and inductions for students of classes 6-8. Here at Enigma, we focus on knowledge-based quizzing over rote learning. I focus on the  
      SPENT (Sports and Entertainment) field of quizzes and am learning MELA (Music Entertainment Literature and Arts) field as well.
